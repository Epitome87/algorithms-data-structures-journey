# Data Structures & Algorithms Masterclass - By Colt Steel

## Section 2: Big O Notation

- For a clever "Add up to n numbers" algorithm: return n \* (n + 1) / 2
- Things like assignments to variables, addition, subtraction, multiplication, modulo, increment, decrement, comparisons, etc are all "operations" that we can count to measure potential performance. Exact number doesn't matter! Just how the number of operations scales with n.
- Big O Notation is a way to formalize fuzzy counting. It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input grows. Technically: We say that an algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times f(n), as n increases. Example: f(n) could be linear (f(n) = n) or f(n) could be quadratic (f(n) = n^2) or f(n) could be constant (f(n) = 1) etc. Above is read like "there's a function of input of n and it's output is <n, n^2, constant, etc>
- Constants Don't Matter! O(4n) is just O(n). Smaller Terms Don't Matter! O(n + 300) is just O(n). O(n^2 + 5n + 8) is just O(n^2)
- Big O Shorthands: 1) Arithmetic operations are constant. 2) Variable assignment is constant. 3) Accessing elements in an array (by index) or object (by key) is constant. 4) In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside of the loop.
- Space Complexity: Sometimes you'll hear the term **auxiliary space complexity** to refer to space required by the algorithm, NOT including space taken up by the inputs. We don't care about how the input itself grows -- only the repercussions of it inside the algorithm. We assume one is typically talking about auxiliary space, unless mentioned otherwise.
- Space Complexity: Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are constant space. Strings require O(n) space (where n is the string length). Reference types are generally O(n), where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects).
- Logarithm: When we see Log2(8) = 3, we are asking: "2, to what power, is equal to 8? The answer is 3!"). Log2(value) = exponent => 2^exponent = value
- Logarithm: Most common bases are 2 (binary) and 10, and sometimes E. We care only about the big picture, so we omit the base.
- Logarithm: Rule of Thumb: The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 **before you get a value that's less than or equal to one**
- Logarithm: Why Care? Certain searching algorithms have lg time complexity. Efficient sorting algorithms involve logs. Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity.

## Section 3: Analyzing Performance of Arrays & Objects

- Objects: When To Use: 1) You don't need order. 2) You want fast access / insertion and removal. Insertion: O(1). Removal: O(1). Searching: O(N). Access / Change: O(1)
- Objects: Behind the scenes (hash maps)
- Objects: By "searching" we don't mean looking for a key; we mean checking if a given piece of information is in a value somewhere. That is, if we ask "does the value of "Matthew" exist for any key in the object?". We have to search every key and retrieve its value.
- Objects: Methods: 1) Object.keys = O(N). 2) Object.values = O(N). Object.entries = O(N). hasOwnProperty = O(1). Example: student.hasOwnProperty("firstName") (returns true or false), constant because if we are able to access the value of a key in constant time, we should also be able to access if a key exist in the same amount of time!
- Arrays: When To Use: 1) You need order. 2) When you need fast access / insertion and removal (sort of...)
- Arrays: Big O of Arrays: 1) Insertion - it depends... 2) Removal - it depends... 3) Searching - O(N). Access - O(1).
- Arrays: Inserting at beginning of array = O(N), we have to shift each element over to accommodate the new indices. Inserting at the end of array = O(1), there is no extra adjustments needed. Removing at beginning of array = O(N), we have to re-index, just the opposite direction of Insert. Searching: The fastest we can do is O(N): If we have an Array of 1,000 elements and I want to know if "Matthew" is in there, we have to potentially check all 1,000 elements until we finally find it!
- Arrays: Methods: Push / Pop: O(1). Shift / Unshift: O(N). Concat, Slice, Splice: O(N). Sort: O(N \* log N). forEach / Map / Filter / Reducer / etc: O(N)
- Arrays: Concat: Technically O(N + M), the size of Array 1 and the size of Array 2. But O(N) is fine. Expresses the fact that as these arrays grow that you're merging, so is the time that it's going to take, grows in proportional with the size of the total size of the new array at end.

## Section 4: Problem-Solving Approach

- Algorithm: A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.
- How to improve? 1) Device a plan for solving problems. 2) Master common problem solving patterns. This section covers approaches for problem solving.
- Problem Solving Steps: 1) Understand the Problem. 2) Explore Concrete Examples. 3) Break It Down. 4) Solve / Simplify. 5) Look Back & Refactor.
- 1. Understand The Problem - Ask yourself (or interviewer) this: 1) Can I restate the problem in my own words? 2) What are the inputs that go into the problem? 3) What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? 4) Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough info to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.) 5) How should I label the important pieces of data that are a pat of the problem?
- 2. Explore Concrete Examples - Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better. Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should. (Unit Tests, User Stories). Write down a few simple examples. Progress to more complex examples. Explore examples with empty inputs. Explore examples with edge cases. Explore examples with invalid inputs (maybe not in interviews).
- 3. Break It Down - Take the actual steps of the problem and write it down. Doesn't have to be valid syntax or full pseudo code, just little comments serving as a guide. Communicate to the interviewer what steps you are going to try to take. You can throw in hints: "Does that sound like it'll work?". This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax).
- 4. Solve / Simplify - Solve the problem, but if you can't...Solve a simpler problem! Ignore the part that's giving you a hard time -- focus on everything else. Instead of making zero progress, it's better to do the stuff you know how to do at least. While doing so, you may gain insight into the harder part of the problem. Simplification Steps: _ Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do. _ Temporarily ignore that difficulty. _ Write a simplified solution. _ Then incorporate that difficulty back in (if you can).
- 5. Look Back & Refactor - Strive for achieving something beyond "the code works!" How's it read? How easy is it to understand? How efficient? Refactoring Questions - _ Can you check the result? _ Can you derive the result differently? _ Can you understand it at a glance? _ Can you use the result or method for some other problem?** \*Can you improve the performance of your solution?** _ Can you think of other ways to refactor? (Does it follow company guidelines, conventions of the language) _ How have other people solved this problem? Ask questions after about the most effective way to solve this (if interview) -- seem genuinely interested!
- CODE SNIPPET: Instead of if-else, consider: array[i] = ++array[i] || 1; This line is saying that if array[i] is truthy, increment it, otherwise set it to 1;

## Section 5: Problem Solving Patterns

- Step 2 of how do you improve -- Problem-solving patterns!
- Some Patterns... _ Frequency Counter. 2_ Multiple Pointers. _ Sliding Window. _ Divide & Conquer. _ Dynamic Programming. _ Greedy Algorithms. _ Backtracking. _ Many more!
- Frequency Counter Patterns: This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations w/ arrays/strings. Useful in algorithms when you have multiple pieces of data -- multiple inputs --and you need to compare them to see if they consist of similar values, if they are anagrams of one another, if a value is contained inside of another value. In particular if you need to see if they consist of the same individual pieces, if numbers consist of same digits just in different order.
- Multiple Pointers Pattern: Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position & move towards the beginning, end or middle based on certain conditions. Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well. Usually have some linear structure, and we're searching for pair of values. Work towards each other, in same direction, etc.
- **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT** When we're passing Arrays (and objects?) into functions and then changing those arrays in the function, it changes the input array as well!
- Sliding Window Pattern: This pattern involves creating a **window** which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created). Very useful for keeping track of subset of data in an array/string etc. Useful for when we're looking for a subset of data that is continuous in some way.
- Sliding: Useful for longest sequence of unique characters, max subarray sum (max sum of n consecutive elements)
- Divide & Conquer Pattern: This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data. This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity. Divide into smaller pieces, doing something to each smaller piece. Example: Binary Search.

## Section 6: Optional Challenges

## Section 7: Recursion

- What is recursion?
  A process (a function in our case) that calls itself.
- Why should I care?
  It's everywhere
  _ JSON.parse / JSON.stringy - often written recursively
  _ document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
  _ Object traversal
  _ More complex data structures \* Sometimes cleaner alternative to iteration
- The Call Stack - Behind the Scenes
  Any time a function is involved, it's placed (pushed) on the top of the call stack
  When JS sees the return keyword or when function ends, the compiler will remove (pop)
- How Recursive Functions Work
  Invoke the same function w/ a different input until you reach your base case
  Base Case: the condition when the recursion ends
- Common Recursion Pitfalls
  - No base case, or incorrect base case
  - Forgetting to return, or returning the wrong thing
  - Can result in a Stack overflow -- too many calls on the stack!
- Helper Method Recursion - Common Pattern
  - Main outer function, with a function defined in it that calls itself recursively
  - Useful if we need to collect/build results up, which would otherwise be lost on each new call of recursive function
    function collectOdd(array) {
    let result = [];
    funciton helper(helpernput) {
    // Logic, push data into result, then call itself again
    }
    helper(arr);
    return result;
    }
    collectOdd(arrayData);
- Pure Recursion - No Helper Method, Self-contained
  function collectOdd(arr) {
  let newArr = [];
  if (arr.length === 0) return newArr;
  if (arr[0] % 2 !=== 0) newArr.push(arr[0]);
  newArr = newArr.concat(collectOdd(arr.slice(1)));
  return newArr;
  }
  - Pure Recursion Tips:
    - For arrays, use methods like slice, the spread operator, and concat that make copies of arrays so you do not mutate them
    - Remember that strings are immutable, so you'll need to use methods like slice, substr, or substring to make copies of strings
    - To make copies of objects, use Object.assign, or the spread operator

## Section 8: Optional - Recursion Problem Set

## Section 9: Optional - Challenging Recursion Problems

## Section 10: Searching Algorithms

- Objectives:
  - Describe what a searching algo is
  - Implement linear search on arrays
  - Implement binary search on sorted arrays
  - Implement a naive string searching algorithm
  - Implement the KMP string searching algorithm
- Linear Search:
  - Just look at every single element, in order, to see if it's what we want
    - Not necessarily bad - especially if data is unsorted
  - JavaScript has search! Behind the scenes, these functions are doing a linear search:
    - indexOf, includes, find, findIndex
  - Linear Search Psuedocode:
    - Function accepts an array and a value
    - Loop through the array and check if the current array element is === the value
    - If it is, return the index at which the element is found
    - If the value is never found, return -1
  - Big O:
    - Best: O(1) Average: O(n) Worst: O(n)
- Binary Search:
  - Much faster form of search. Can eliminate half the remaining elements at a time. Only works on sorted data!
  - Binary Search Psuedocode:
    - Function accepts an array and a value
    - Create a left pointer at start of the array, and a right pointer at the end of the array
    - While the left pointer comes before the right pointer
      - Create a pointer in the middle
      - If you find value you want, return index
      - If value is too small, move the left pointer up
      - If value is too large, move the right pointer down
    - If you never find the value, return -1
  - Big O:
    - Worst and Average: O(log n) Best case: O(1)
    - Every time we double the data, we add only one step!
    - Can ask: 2 to what power gives me the length of the data? That power is the number of steps!
      Example: 2 to what power gives me 256? 8!
- Searching for Substrings in a String:
  - "Naive" String Search
    - Psuedocode:
      _ Loop over the longer string
      _ Loop over the shorter string
      _ If the chars don't match, break out of the inner Loop
      _ If the chars do match, keep going
      _ If you complete the inner loop and find a match, increment the count of matches
      _ Return the count
      function naiveStringSearch(str, pattern) {
      let count = 0;
      for (let i = 0; i <= str.length - pattern.length; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < pattern.length; j++) {
      if (str[i + j] !== pattern[j]) break;
      if (j === pattern.length - 1) count++;
      }
      }
      return count;
      }

## Section 11: Bubble Sort

- Sorting: Why do we need to learn this? - Sorting is a common task, so it's good to know how it works. - There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages. - Good to know what algorithm default JavaScript (and others) use behind the scenes, and therefore what it's good and bad at.
- JS built-in sort: Bad on numbers! It's doing so according to their Unicode values of their corresponding to strings. That's by calling just .sort() with no params. You can also specify a comparator function in the sort param: this tells JS how to sort. The comparator looks at pairs of elements (and and b), determines their sort order based on the return value: if it returns negative number, a should come before b. If positive number, b comes before a.
- Bubble Sort: The largest values bubble up to the top, one at a time. Many swaps can happen during each iteration.
- Bubble Sort psuedocode: 1) Start looping from the end of the array towards the beginning, with a variable called i. 2) Start an inner loop with a variable called j, from the beginning until i - 1. 3) If arr[j] is greater than arr[j+1], swap those two values!

## Section 12: Selection Sort

- Selection Sort: Similar to bubble, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position at the end of array, it places small values into sorted position one at a time -- making at most one swap per iteration.
- Selection Sort pseudo code: 1) Store the 1st element as the smallest value you've seen so far. 2) Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number. 3) If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum" (this is an **index** of where that value was found, not the value!) and continue until the end of the array. 4) If the "min" is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values. 5) Repeat this process, starting with the **next** element, until the array is sorted.
- Selection Sort: Complexity of O(N^2) (even though technically it's N comparisons for each item , then N - 1, then N - 2, etc).
- Selection Sort: Potentially better than Bubble Sort if you want to minimize the number of swaps you're making. Usually minimizing swaps isn't a big concern, though.

## Section 13: Insertion Sort

- Insertion Sort: Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left portion which is always sorted. Takes each element and insert it exactly where it should go within the sorted portion. It does this by swapping backwards until it is in place.
- Insertion psuedocode: 1) Start by picking the second element in the array (first element is already considered sorted). 2) Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary. 3) Continue to the next element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion (i.e the left side) to place the element in the correct place. 4) Repeat until array is sorted. 5) Return array!
- Insertion Sort: Worst (and average) case for Space Complexity is O(N^2) (quadratic). If data is almost all sorted, bad if it's completely reversed. Good at online algorithms.
- **ONLINE ALGORITHM** Algorithm that can work as data is coming in -- as it is receiving new data.

## Section 14: Comparing Bubble, Selection, and Insertion sort

    Algorithms      Time (Best)     Time (Avg)      Time (Worst)        Space
    Bubble          O(N)            O(N^2)          O(N^2)              O(1)
    Insertion       O(N)            O(N^2)          O(N^2)              O(1)
    Selection       O(N^2)          O(N^2)          O(N^2)              O(1)

- Recap:

  - Bubble, Selection, and Insertion sort are all roughly equivalent
  - All have avg time complexities that are quadratic
  - Can perform better on some very small data sets - so not complete waste of time to know!

    Sections 15 - 17: Intermediate Sorting Algorithms O(n log n)

## Section 15: Merge sort

- Introduction:
  - Combination of two things - merging and sorting
  - Exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 elements are always sorted
  - Works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a newly sorted array
- Merging:

  - In order to implement Merge Sort, it's useful to implement a function responsible for merging two sorted array
    - Given two arrays which are sorted, this helper function should create a new array which is also sorted, and consists of all
      the elements in the two input arrays
    - This function should run in O(n + m) time and O(n + m) space and should not modify the parameters passed to it
  - Merging Arrays Psuedocode:

    - Create an empty array, take a look at the smallest values in each input
    - While there are still values we haven't loked at...
      _ If the value in the first array is smaller than the value in the second array, push the value in the first array into our results
      and move onto the next value in the first array
      _ If the value in the first array is larger than the value in the second array, push the value in the second array into our results
      and move onto the next value in the second array \* Once we exhaust one array, push in all remaining values from the other array

      ```js
      function merge(arr1, arr2) {
        const mergedArray = [];
        let i = 0;
        let j = 0;

        while (i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length) {
          if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
            mergedArray.push(arr1[i]);
            i++;
          } else {
            mergedArray.push(arr2[j]);
            j++;
          }
        }

        while (i < arr1.length) {
          mergedArray.push(arr1[i]);
          i++;
        }
        while (j < arr2.length) {
          mergedArray.push(arr2[j]);
          j++;
        }

        return mergedArray;
      }
      ```

- Merge Sort Psuedocode:
  _ Break up the array into halves until you have arrays that are empty or have one element
  _ Once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge those arrays with the other sorted arrays until you are back at the full length of the array \* Once the array has been merged back together, return the merged (and sorted!) array

  ```js
  function mergeSort(array) {
    if (array.length <= 1) return array;

    let mid = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
    const left = mergeSort(array.slice(0, mid));
    const right = mergeSort(array.slice(mid));
    return merge(left, right);
  }
  ```

- Big O of Merge Sort:
  - Time, best, average, and worst: O(n log n)
  - Space: O(n)
    Doesn't care what the input is; going to keep spliting it in half in all scenario
  - How many times do we have to split an array of length nNto get single element arrays? log N
  - Where's the N in n log n come in?
    Each time we split it, we have n comparisons done in the merge helper function
    Thus: O(log n) decomposition x O(n) comparisons per decomposition
    Therefore, O(n log n)
  - O(n log n) is the best we can get for a sorting algorithm, unless the algo itself takes advantage of soem weird quirk in the data
    (Example: radix sort uses particular quirk of numbers to sort faster, but only on numbers)

## Section 16: Quick Sort

- Intro:
  - Like Merge Sort, exploits fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
  - Works by selecting one element ("pivot") and finding the index where the pivot should end up in the sorted away
  - Once pivot is positioned appropriately, Quick Sort can be applied on either side of the pivot
- Pivot Helper Intro:
  - In order to implement merge, it's useful to first implement a funciton responsible for ararnging elements in an array on either side of pivot
    - Given an array, this helper funciton should designate an element as the pivot
    - It should then rearrange elements in teh array so that all values less than the pivot are m oved to the left of the pivot
      and all values greater than the pivot are moved to the right of the pivot
    - The order of elements on either side of the pivot does not matter
    - The helper should do this IN PLACE -- it should not create new array
    - When complete, the helper should return the index of the pivot
  - Picking a pivot:
    - The runtime of quick sort depends in part on how one selecst the pivot
    - Ideally, the pivot should be chosen so that it's roughly the median value in the data set you're sorting
    - For somplicity, we'll choose the pivot to be the first element (we'll talk about consequence of this later)
  - Psuedocode:
    - It will help to accept 3 args: array, start index, end index (can default to 0 and the array length - 1 respectively)
    - Grab the pivot from the start of the array
    - Store the current pivot index in a variable (this will keep track of where the pivot should end up)
    - Loop through the array from start until end:
      - If the pivot is greater than current element, increment the pivot index variable and the nswap the current element w/ the element at the pivot index
    - Swap the starting element (i.e. the pivot) w/the pivot index
    - Return the pivot index
- Quick Sort - Psuedocode:
  _ Call the pivot helper on the full array
  _ When the helper returns the updated pivot index, recursively call the pivot helper on the subarray to the left of that index
  and the subarray to the right of that index \* The base case occurs when you consider a subarray with less than 2 elements (start === end or end < start)

  ```js
  function pivot(array, start = 0, end = array.length - 1) {
    let pivotValue = array[start];
    let pivotIndex = start;

    for (let i = start + 1; i < array.length; i++) {
      if (pivotValue > array[i]) {
        pivotIndex++;
        swap(array, i, pivotIndex);
      }
    }
    swap(array, start, pivotIndex);

    return pivotIndex;
  }
  ```

```js
function quickSort(array, start = 0, end = array.length - 1) {
  if (start < end) {
    let pivot = pivot(array, start, end);
    quickSort(array, start, pivot - 1);
    quickSort(array, pivot + 1, end);
  }
  return array;
}
```

## Section 17: Radix Sort

### Radix Sort - Introduction

- Best average case time complexity for comparison sorts: n log n
  - But we can do better! With..
- Radix Sort:
  - Special sorting algorithm that works on lists of numbers
  - It never makes comparisons between elements!
  - Exploits the fact that info about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits

### Radix Sort - Helper Methods

- In order to implement Radix Sort, it's helpful to build a few helper functions first

  - getDigit(num, place) - returns the digit in num at the given palce value. Two strategies:

    - 1. Convert into a string, then back into a number. Problem: Strings are indexed from left side
    - 2. Each position represents a power to the 10. Divide by that power of 10

    ```js
    function getDigit(num, i) {
      return Math.floor(Math.abs(num) / Math.pow(10, i)) % 10;
    }

    getDigit(7323,2);
    <!-- Steps: 1) 7323/100  = 73.23 2) Floor(73.23) = 73 3) 73%10 = 3 -->
    ```

  - digitCount(num) = returns the number of digits in num

    ```js
    function digitCount(num) {
      if (num === 0) return 1;
      return Math.floor(Math.log10(Math.abs(num))) + 1;
    }

    digitCount(423);
    <!-- Steps: Ask: "10 to what power gives us 423?" 1) Math.log10(423) = 2.6263 2) Floor(2.6263) = 2 3) Add 1: 2 + 1 = 3 -->
    ```

  - mostDigits(nums) = Given an array of numbers, returns the number of digits in the largest numbers in the list
    ```js
    function mostDigits(nums) {
      let maxDigits = 0;
      for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        maxDigits = Math.max(maxDigits, digitCount(nums[i]));
      }
      return maxDigits;
    }
    ```

### Radix Sort - Psuedocode

- Define a function that accepts a list of numbers
- Figure out how many digits the largest number has
- Loop from k = 0 up to this largest number of digits
- For each iteration of the loop:
  - Create buckets for each digit (0 to 9)
  - Place each number in the corresponding bucket based on its kth digit
- Replace our existing array with values in our buckets, starting with 0 and goig up to 9
- Return list at the end

### Radix Sort - BIG O Complexity

- | Time Complexity (Best) | Time Complexity (Avg) | Time Complexity (Worst) | Space Complexity |
  | ---------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
  | O(nk)                  | O(nk)                 | O(nk)                   | O(n + k)         |

- n - Length of array
- k - Number of digits (average)

- Typically, this is argued to be the same as O(n log n) due to how computers store numbers in memory

## Section 18: Data Structures - Introduction

- Data Structures
  - What do they do?
    - Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data
  - Why So Many?
    - Different data structures excel at different things. Soem are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.
  - Why Care?
    - JavaScript doesn't support any of these out of the box
    - The more time you spend as a dev, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures
    - Worked with many of them unkowingly already!
    - INTERVIEWS!!!
  - There Is No One "Best" Data Structures
    - They all excel in different situation
    - Working w/ map/location data? Use a Graph!
    - Need ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? Use a Linked List!
    - Web scraping nested HTML? Use a Tree!
    - Need to write a scheduler? Use a Binary Heap!
- ES2015 Class Syntax Overview
  - JS impelments the IDEA of classes -- but it's not real object-oriented programming
  - Class: Blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods
  - Classes are syntantical sugar over prototype based inheritance. Does not introduce a new OOP inheritance model to the language
  - Example:
    class Student {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    }
    - The method to create new objects MUST be called constructor.
    - The class keyword creates a constant, so you can not redefined it.
  - Creating Objects From Classes
    - We use the "new" keyword:
      - let firstStudent = new Student("Colt", "Steele");
- Adding Instance Methods:
  - Provide functionality that lives on a single instance of the class
- Adding Class Methods:
  - Static keyword defines a static method for a class
    - Static methods are called without instantiating their class and cannot be called through a class instance.
    - Often used to create utlity functions for an applied
  - Example:
    class Student { constructor() static EnrollStudents() }
    Student.EnrollStudents();

## Section 19: Singly-Linked List

- Singly-Linked List Introduction
  - What is a Linked List?
    - A data structure that contains a head, tail, and length
    - Consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to "next" node or null
    - No index to reference like with an array
    - Each node only connected one direction to next node. No pointer to previous node
  - Head: Beginning of Linked List
  - Tail: End of Linked List
  - Comparisons w/ Arrays:
    Lists Arrays
    - Don't have indexes \* Indexed in order
    - Connected via ndoes w/a "next" pointer \* Insertion and deletion can be expensive
    - Random access is not allowed \* Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
- Starter Code & Push Intro
  - Push - Psuedocode:
    - This function accepts a value
    - Creates a new node using the value passed to the function
    - If there is no head property on list, set the head & tail to be the newly created node
    - Otherwise, set the next property on the tail to be the new ndoe and set the tail proeprty on the list to be the newly created node
    - Increment the length by 1
    - Return the SinglyLinkedList
- Pop - Intro:
  - Removing a node from the end of the Singly Linked List
  - Pop - Psuedocode:
    - If there are no nodes in the list, return undefined
    - Otherwise, loop through the list until you reach the tail (technically trying to get the node right BEFORE the tail)
    - Set the next property to be the 2nd to last node
    - Decrement the length of the list by 1
    - Return the value of the ndoe removed
- Shift
  - Removing a node from the beginning of the Linked List
  - Shift - Psuedocode:
    - If there are no nodes, return undefined
    - Store the current head property in a variable
    - Set the head property to be the current head's next property
    - Decrement the length by 1
      - (Fix: Tail won't be null if shift leads to empty list. So we add a check: if (length === 0, set tail to null))
    - Return the value of the node removed
- Unshift
  - Adding a new node to the beginning of the Linked List
  - Unshift - Psuedocode:
    - This function should accept a value that you're Adding
    - Create a new node using the value passed to the function
    - If there is no head property on the list, set the head & tail to be the newly created node
    - Otherwise, set the newly created node's next property to be the current head property on the list
    - Set the head property on the list to be that newly created node
    - Increment the length of the list by 1
    - Return the linked list
- Get
  - Retrieving a node by its position in the Linked List (have to manually count from the start, unlike Array)
  - Get - Psuedocode:
    - This function should accept an index
    - If the index is less than zero or greater than or equal to the length of the list, return null
    - Loop through the list until you reach the index & return the node at that specific index
- Set
  - Changing the value of a node based on its position in the Linked List
  - Set - Psuedocode:
    - This function should accept an index and a value
    - Use your get function to find the specific node
    - If the node is not found, return false
    - If the node is found, set the value of that node to be the value passed to the function and return true
- Insert
  - Adding a node to the Linked List at a specific position
  - Unlike Set, which updates an existing node, this is inserting a new node!
  - Insert - Psuedocode:
    - If the index is less than 0 or greater than the length, return false
    - If the index is the same as the length, just push a new node to the end of the list (via our push method!)
    - If the index is 0, unshift a new node to the start of the list (via our unshift method!)
    - Otherwise, using the "get" method, access the node at the index - 1 (previous node to where we want to insert)
    - Set the "next" property on that ndoe to be the new node
    - Set the next property on the new node to be the previous "next"
    - Increment the length
    - Return true
- Remove
  - Removing a node from the Linked List at a specific position
  - Remove - Psuedocode:
    - If the index is less than 0 or greater than the length, return undefined
    - If the index is the same as the length - 1, pop
    - If the index is 0, shift
    - Otherwise, using the "get" method, access the ndoe at the index - 1
    - Set the "next" property on that node to be the "next" of the next node
    - Decrement the length
    - Return the value of the node removed
- Reverse
  - Reversing the Linked List...IN PLACE!
  - Common challenge for interviews
  - Reverse - Psuedocode:
    - Swap the head and tail
    - Create a variable called "next"
    - Create a variable called "prev"
    - Create a variable called ndoe and initialize it to the head property
    - Loop through the list
      - Set the "next" to be the "next" property on whatever node is
      - Set the next property on the node to be whatever "prev" is
      - Set the "prev" to be the value of the node variable
      - Set the node variable to be the value of the next variable
- Big O of Linked List

  - Insertion - O(1) \* Wins over array!
  - Removal - It depends...O(1) or O(N) \* O(1) from beginning, O(N) from end or elsewhere
  - Searching - O(N) _ Have to start search from the start _ Loss over array's constant-time
  - Access - O(N) _ Have to start access from the start _ Loss over array's constant-time
  - Recap:
    - Excellent alt to arrays when insert/deltion at beginning are frequently required
    - Arrays contain a built in index whereas Linked Lists do not
    - Idea of list data structure that consists of ndoes is the foundation for other data structures like Stacks & Queues
    -

  const data = Array.apply(null, { length: 10 }).map(Function.call, Math.random);

## Section 20: Doubly-Linked Lists

### Doubly Linked Lists Introduction

- Almost identical to Singly Linked Lists, except every node has another pointer - to the previous node!
- Don't have to traverse entire list to remove the last item (like Singly Linked); can just work backwards!
- Huge pain to go backwards in Singly Linked List; very simple with Doubly Linked List!
- However, Doubly uses more memory! ☹

### Setting Up Our Node Class

- The _finished_ Node class:

```js
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
    this.previous = null;
  }
}
```

- The _starter_ DoublyLinkedList class:

```js
class DoublyLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }
}
```

### Push

- Adding a Node to the _end_ of the Doubly Linked List

- Push Pseudocode:
  - Create a new Node with the value passed to the function
  - If the head property is null (or length 0) set the head and tail to be the newly created node
  - If not, set the next property on the tail to be that node
  - Set the previous property on the newly created node to be the tail
  - Set the tail to be the newly created tail

```js
push(value) {
  // Create a new Node
  let newNode = new Node(value);

  //  If list is empty (can also check if length === 0)
  if (!this.head) {
    this.head = newNode;
    this.tail = newNode;
  }

  else {
    // Set the tail's "next" to be the newly-created Node
    this.tail.next = newNode;

    // Set this newly-created Node's "previous" to be our current (soon to be old) "tail"
    newNode.previous = this.tail;

    // Set the tail to be the newly-created node
    this.tail = newNode;

    // Set this newly-created Node's "next" to be null -- no items exist past this node yet
    // newNode.next = null; // Not necessary; we do this by default in Node constructor
    }

    // Increment length to reflect adding the new node
    this.length++;

    // Return the list
    return this;
}
```

### Pop

- Removing a Node from the _end_ of the Doubly Linked List
- Pop Pseudocode:
  - If there is no head (or tail, or length 0) return undefined
  - Otherwise, store the current tail in a variable to return later
  - Special case: If the length is 1, set the head and tail to be null
  - Update the tail to be the previous Node
  - Set the _new_ tail's "next" to be null
  - Decrement the length
  - Return the value that was removed
- **NOTE** we want to cut off all linkages from the returned value to the List (i.e set its next and previous to null)

```js
pop() {
  // If empty List, nothing to remove!
  if (!this.head) {
    return undefined;
  }

  // Store our current tail; we want to return this as the value we removed!
  let removedNode = this.tail;

  if (this.length === 1) {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
  }

  else {
    // Change tail to be its previous
    this.tail = removedNode.previous;

    // Ensure there is no pointer to a next node from our tail, as our tail is the last item
    this.tail.next = null;

    // Also clean up the pointers for our removed node
    removedNode.prev = null;
  }

  // Decrement the length
  this.length--;

  // Return the item that was removed, as stored earlier
  return removedNode;
}
```

### Shift

- Removing a Node from the _beginning_ of the Doubly Linked List
- Shift Pseudocode:
  - If the length is 0, return undefined
  - Otherwise, store the current head property in a variable (old head)
  - Special case: If the length is one:
    - Set the head to be null
    - Set the tail to be null
  - Otherwise, update the head to be the next of the old head
  - Set the head's previous property to null
  - Set the old head's next to null
  - Decrement the length
  - Return the old head

```js
shift() {
  if (!this.head) return undefined;

// Store the current head
  let removedHead = this.head;

  // Simple case for when there is only one Node in list
  if (this.length === 1) {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
  } else {
    // Update the head to be the "next" of the old head
    this.head = removedHead.next;

    // Set the new head's previous property to null
    this.head.previous = null;

    // Set the old head's "next" to be null
    removedHead.next = null;
  }

  // Decrement the length of the list by 1
  this.length--;

  // Return the old head that was just removed
  return removedHead;
}
```

### Unshift

- Adding a Node to the _beginning_ of the Doubly Linked List
- Unshift Pseudocode:
  - Create a new Node with the value passed to the function
  - If the length is 0:
    - Set the head to be the new node
    - Set the tail to be the new node
  - Otherwise:
    - Set the previous property on the head of the list to be the new node
    - Set the next property on the new node to be the head property
    - Update the head to be the new node
  - Increment the length
  - Return the list

```js
// Create new node
// Set its next to be the current head
// Set the current head's previous to be new node
// Set head to be new node
unshift(value) {
  // Create a new Node with the value passed in
  let newNode = new Node(value);

  // If the list is empty...
  if (!this.head) {
    // The head and tail point to the same new Node
    this.head = newNode;
    this.tail = newNode;
  } else {
    // Set the previous pointer of the old head to be the new Node
    this.head.previous = newNode;

    // Set the next pointer of the newly-created Node to be the old head
    newNode.next = this.head;

    // And set the new head to be the newly-created Node
    this.head = newNode;
  }

  // Increment the length of the list
  this.length++;

  // Finally, returned the Doubly Linked List
  return this;
}
```

### Get

- Accessing a Node in a Doubly Linked List by its position
- Unlike Singly Linked List where we have to traverse from the beginning of the List until we reach our desired index...

  - We can decide: Should we start at the beginning, or the end of the list? We base this on the desired index provided

- Get Pseudocode:
  - Valid index? If the index is less than 0 or greater or equal to the length, return null
  - If the index is less than or equal to half the length of the list
    - Loop through the list starting from the head and loop towards the middle
    - Return the Node once it is found
  - If the index is greater than half the length of the list
    - Loop through the list starting from the tail and loop towards the middle
    - Return the Node once it is found

```js
get(index) {
  // Check if the index is valid
  if (index < 0 || index >= this.length) return null;

  let count;
  let current;

  // If the index is closer to start of the list than the end...
  if (index <= this.length / 2) {
    count = 0;
    current = this.head;
    while (count != index) {
      current = current.next;
      count++;
    }
  }
  // If the index is closer to the end of the list than the start of it...
  else {
    count = this.length - 1;
    current = this.tail;
    while (count != index) {
      current = current.previous;
      count--;
    }
  }

  return current;
}
```

### Set

- Replacing the value of a Node to a new value in a Doubly Linked List
- Set Pseudocode:
  - Create a variable which is the result of the _get_ method at the index passed to the function
    - If the _get_ method returns a valide Node, set the value of that node to be the value passed to the function
    - Return true
  - Otherwise, return false

```js
set(index, value) {
  const foundNode = this.get(index);
  if (foundNode != null) {
    foundNode.value = value;
    return true;
  }

  return false;
}
```

### Insert

- Adding a Node in a Doubly Linked List by a certain position
- Insert Pseudocode:
  - If the index is less than zero or greater than or equal to the length, return false
  - If the index is 0, use unshift
  - If the index is the equal to the length, use push
  - Otherwise, use the get method to access the index - 1
  - Set the next and previous properties on the correct Nodes to link everything together
  - Increment the length
  - Return true

```js
insert(index, value) {
  // Ensure the desired index is valid
  if (index < 0 || index > this.length) return false;

  // If the list is empty, simply use unshift
  if (index === 0) return !!this.unshift(value);

  // If we want to insert at the end, simply use push
  else if (index === this.length) return !!this.push(value);

  // Otherwise, we're inserting in another location: Need new logic!
  let preNode = get(index - 1);
  let newNode = new Node(value);
  let postNode = preNode.next;

  // Update the pre-Node's link - it points next to the newly-created Node
  preNode.next = newNode;

  // Set the newly-created Node's links
  newNode.next = postNode;
  newNode.previous = preNode;

  // Update the post-Node's link - it points previous to the newly-created Node
  postNode.previous = newNode;

  // Increment the length of the list by 1
  this.length++;

  return true;
}
```

### Remove

- Removing a Node in a Doubly Linked List by a certain position
- Remove Pseudocode:
  - If the index is less than zero or greater than or equal to the length, return undefined
  - If the index is 0, use _shift_
  - If the index is equal to the length - 1, use _pop_
  - Otherwise, use the _get_ method to retrieve the item to be removed
  - Update the next and previous properties to remove the found Node from the list
  - Set next and previous to null on the found Node
  - Decrement the length
  - Return the removed Node

```js
remove(index) {
  // Ensure the desired index is valid
  if (index < 0 || index >= this.length) return undefined;

  // If we want to remove the first item, simply use shift
  if (index === 0) return this.shift();

  // If we watn to remove the last item, simply use pop
  if (index === this.length - 1) return this.pop();

  // Otherwise, we wish to remove an item in another locaton: Create new logic for that!
  let removedNode = this.get(index);
  let preNode = removedNode.previous;
  let postNode = removedNode.next;

  // Update the links of the Nodes that come before and after the removed Node
  preNode.next = postNode;      // May see written as removedNode.prev.next = removedNode.next -- UGLY!
  postNode.previous = preNode;  // May see written as removedNode.next.prev = removedNode.prev -- UGLY!

  // Clean up the links for the Node we are removing
  removedNode.next = null;
  removedNode.previous = null;

  // Decrement the length of the list by 1
  this.length--;

  return removedNode;
}
```

### Comparing Singly & Doubly Linked Lists

- Big O of Doubly Linked Lists
  - Insertion - O(1) Same as Singly Linked
  - Removal - O(1) Always! Not the same for Singly, where removal from end is slow
  - Searching - O(N) (Technically searching is O(N/2), but that's still O(N) like Singly)
  - Access - O(N)
- Recap:
  - Doubly Linked Lists are almost identical to Singly, except there is an additional pointer to previous nodes
  - Better than Singly for finding nodes and can be done in half the time!
  - However, they do take up more memory considering the extra pointer

## Section 21: Stacks and Queues

### Introduction to Stacks

- What is a Stack?
  - A LIFO data structure
    - The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack
    - The first element added in will be the last thing to be removed
    - Think about a stack of plates
- Where are Stacks used?
  - Managing function invocations (the call stack)
  - Undo / Redo functionality
  - Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack
  - Common algorithms

### Creating a Stack with an Array

- More than one way to implement a Stack
- Array Implementation is the easiest way:
  ```js
  const stack = [];
  stack.push('google');
  stack.push('instagram');
  stack.push('youtube');
  let lastSite = stack.pop();
  ```
  or
  ```js
  stack.unshift('create new file');
  stack.unshif('resized file');
  stack.unshift('cloned out wrinkle');
  let lastAction = stack.shift();
  ```
- Adding and removing from the beginning of an Array is _not good_! So the unshift/shift method is not ideal
- Array in general is not the most ideal way. Linked List would be better (no bloat of superfluous Array methods)

### Writing Our Own Stack From Scratch

- Pushing and Popping are different than our Singly-Linked List implementation...
  - We were dealing with the end of the List in that data structure. But that's bad for Stacks -- we need O(N) push/pop!
- Pushing Pseudocode:

```
  * The function should accept a value
  * Create a new node with that value
  * If there are no nodes in teh stack, set the first and last property to be the newly created node
  * If there is at least one node, create a variable that stores the current first property on the stack
  * Reset the first property to be the newly created node
  * Set the next property on the node to be the previously created variable
  * Increment the size of the stack by 1, and return it
```

- Popping Pseudocode:

```
  * If there are no nodes in the stack, return null
  * Else, create a temporary variable to store the first property on the stack
  * If there is only 1 node, set the first and last property to be null
  * If there is more than one mode, set the first property to be the next property on the current first
  * Decrement the size by 1
  * Return the value of the node removed
```

```js
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.first = null;
    this.last = null;
    this.size = 0;
  }

  push(value) {
    let newNode = new Node(value);
    if (!this.first) {
      this.first = newNode;
      this.last = newNode;
    } else {
      let temp = this.first;
      this.first = newNode;
      this.first.next = temp;
    }

    // Increment size, and return it
    return ++this.size;
  }

  pop(value) {
    if (!this.first) return null;

    let temp = this.first;

    //  Only one node?
    if (this.first === this.last) {
      this.last = null;
    }

    this.first = this.first.next;
    this.size--;

    return temp.value;
  }
}
```

### Big O of Stacks

- Insertion - O(1)
- Removal - O(1)
- Searching - O(N)
- Access - O(N)

- _Note_: Stacks really prioritize insertion and removal!
- Recap:
  - Stacks are a LIFO data structure where the last value in is always the first one out
  - Stacks are not a built-in data structure in JS, but are relatively simple to implement

### Introduction to Queues

- What is a Queue?
  - Similiar to Stack
  - A FIFO data structure: First In First Out
  - Think of a waiting line ("queue" in other countries)
- Where are they used?
  - Background tasks
  - Uploading resources
  - Printing / Task processing
- Can implement with Array or our own Queue class

### Creating Queues Using Arrays

```js
// Push is okay. But removing from the beginning shifts everything over
let queue = [];
queue.push('FIRST');
queue.push('SECOND');
queue.push('THIRD');
queue.shift(); // Removes "First"
queue.shift(); // Removes "Second"
queue.shift(); // Removes "Third"

// Or: Popping works well, but unshift requires re-index of every element
let queue = [];
queue.unshift('FIRST');
queue.unshift('SECOND');
queue.unshift('THIRD');
queue.pop(); // Removes First
queue.pop(); // Removes "Second"
queue.pop(); // Removes "THIRD"
```

- Unlike with a Stack, an Array can't really handle the FIFO nature without the need of a Linked List for O(1) insertion/removal
  - So it's almost necessary to create our own Queue class!

## Writing Our Own Queue From Scratch

- Enqueue Pseudocode:

  - This function accepts some value
  - Create a new node using that value passed to the function
  - If there are no nodes in the queue, set this node to be the first and last property of the queue
  - Otherwise, set the next property on the current last to be that node, and then set the last property of the queue to be that node

- Dequeue Pseudocode:
  - If there is no first property, just return null
  - Store the first property in a variable
  - See if the first is the same as the last (check if there is only 1 node). If so, set the first and last to be null
  - If there is more than 1 node, set the first property to be the next property of first
  - Decrement the size by 1
  - Return the value of the node dequeued

```js
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.first = null;
    this.last = null;
    this.size = 0;
  }
  enqueue(value) {
    let newNode = new Node(value);
    if (!this.first) {
      this.first = newNode;
      this.last = newNode;
    } else {
      this.last.next = newNode;
      this.last = newNode;
    }

    return ++this.size;
  }

  dequeue() {
    if (!this.first) {
      return null;
    }

    let temp = this.first;

    if (this.first === this.last) {
      this.last = null;
    }

    this.first = this.first.next;

    this.size--;

    return temp.value;
  }
}
```

### Big O of Queues

- Insertion - O(1)
- Removal - O(1)
- Searching - O(N)
- Access - O(N)

- _Note_ With array it was not constant time due to re-indexing!

- Recap:
  - Queues are a FIFO data structure; all elements are first in first out
  - Queues are useful for processing tasks and are foundational for more complex data structures and algorithms
  - Insertion and Removal _needs_ be done in O(1) -- otherwise we are using a Stack/Queue for nothing!
